# Project: Smart Home Control System

## Description
Develop a home automation system using MQTT. Create a mobile application to control devices and implement secure access and control mechanisms.

## Example Code (Python, paho-mqtt)
```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print("Connected with result code ", rc)
    client.subscribe("home/+/status")

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"Device {msg.topic} is {msg.payload.decode()}")

client = mqtt.Client()
client.username_pw_set("user", "password")
client.tls_set()
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message
client.connect("broker.hivemq.com", 8883, 60)
client.loop_start()

# Control device
client.publish("home/lamp/set", "ON", qos=1)
```

## Mobile App
- Use Flutter, React Native, or similar frameworks to build the app.
