# MQTT in Resource-Constrained Environments

## Explanation
This section discusses minimizing bandwidth, power conservation, MQTT-SN, and implementation on constrained devices.

### Minimizing Bandwidth
- Use short topic names
- Limit message size

### Power Conservation
- Use sleep modes
- Batch messages

### MQTT-SN
- Designed for sensor networks

### Example (MicroPython):
```python
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient
client = MQTTClient("client_id", "broker.hivemq.com")
client.connect()
client.publish(b"topic", b"msg")
```
