# Data Distribution Service (DDS)

## Overview
Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a middleware protocol and API standard for data-centric connectivity from the Object Management Group (OMG). It enables scalable, real-time, dependable, high-performance and interoperable data exchanges between publishers and subscribers. DDS is widely used in mission-critical systems such as air traffic control, smart grid management, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.
