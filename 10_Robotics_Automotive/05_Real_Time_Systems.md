# Real-Time Systems

## Overview
Real-time systems are computing systems that must respond to events or process data within strict time constraints. These systems are essential in domains like automotive controls, industrial automation, robotics, and aerospace, where timing failures can have severe consequences. This learning path covers real-time operating systems, scheduling algorithms, design patterns, and implementation techniques necessary for developing reliable and deterministic real-time applications.
