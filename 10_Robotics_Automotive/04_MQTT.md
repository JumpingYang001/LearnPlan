# MQTT Protocol

## Overview
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. It is ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, mobile applications, and any scenario where network bandwidth is limited. MQTT minimizes network bandwidth and device resource requirements while ensuring reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.
