# Compiler Optimization Techniques

## Overview
Compiler optimization techniques improve the efficiency of code by enhancing execution speed, reducing memory usage, or decreasing power consumption without changing the functionality. Understanding these techniques is essential for developing high-performance applications, embedded systems, and software for resource-constrained environments. This learning path covers various optimization strategies implemented by modern compilers and how developers can leverage them effectively.
