# Bazel and Other Build Tools

## Overview
Bazel is an open-source build and test tool that enables fast, reproducible builds across multiple languages and platforms. It was originally developed by Google and is designed to handle large codebases with complex dependencies. This learning path also covers other important build tools like Buck, Gradle, and Meson, providing a comprehensive understanding of modern build systems and their applications in large-scale software development.
