# Compiler Development and Contribution

## GCC Development Process
- Source organization, building, testing, contribution workflow.

## LLVM Development Process
- Monorepo, building, testing with lit, code review.

## Compiler Debugging Techniques
- Debug builds, logging, IR dumping, test case reduction.

**C Example:**
```c
// Example: Debugging with GDB
gcc -g -o test test.c
gdb ./test
```
