# WebRTC

## Overview
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication capabilities via simple APIs. It enables direct peer-to-peer communication of audio, video, and data without requiring plugins or native apps. WebRTC is essential for building interactive applications like video conferencing, live streaming, file sharing, and more, directly in web browsers and mobile platforms.
