# Protocol Buffers in Production

## Schema Evolution, Best Practices
Use reserved fields, maintain backward compatibility, and integrate with build systems.

## C++ Example: Reserved Fields
```proto
message MyMessage {
  int32 id = 1;
  reserved 2, 3;
  string name = 4;
}
```

// Use version control for .proto files and automate code generation in CI/CD.
