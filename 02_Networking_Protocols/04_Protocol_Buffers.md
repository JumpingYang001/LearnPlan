# Protocol Buffers

## Overview
Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Developed by Google, it's a more efficient alternative to formats like XML or JSON, offering smaller size, faster parsing, and type safety. Protocol Buffers are widely used in microservices architectures, gRPC communication, and various other scenarios where efficient data serialization is crucial.
