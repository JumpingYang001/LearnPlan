# NAT Traversal and Networking

## Overview
Understand ICE, STUN, TURN, and NAT traversal techniques for reliable WebRTC connectivity.

### C/C++ Example: Using STUN (Pseudocode)
```cpp
// Pseudocode for sending a STUN binding request
// Real implementation requires a STUN library
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Create UDP socket
    // Send STUN binding request to server
    // Receive response with public IP/port
    std::cout << "STUN request sent, received public IP." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
