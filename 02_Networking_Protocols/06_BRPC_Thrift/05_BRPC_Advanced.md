# BRPC Advanced Features

## Overview
BRPC provides advanced features like load balancing, service governance, and built-in debugging tools.

## Key Concepts
- Load Balancing: Multiple strategies for distributing requests.
- Service Governance: Monitoring, circuit breaking, etc.
- Built-in Services: Debugging and management endpoints.

## C++ Example: BRPC Load Balancer
```cpp
brpc::Channel channel;
brpc::ChannelOptions options;
options.protocol = "baidu_std";
options.connection_type = "pooled";
options.load_balancer = "rr"; // round-robin
channel.Init("list_of_servers", &options);
// ...existing code for making RPC calls...
```
