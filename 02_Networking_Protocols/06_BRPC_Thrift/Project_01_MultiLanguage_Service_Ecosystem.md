# Project: Multi-language Service Ecosystem

## Description
Build services in C++, Java, and Python using Thrift or BRPC, enabling RPC communication between them. Implement a service discovery mechanism and measure cross-language performance.

## C++ Example: Thrift Service
```thrift
// calculator.thrift
service Calculator {
    i32 add(1:i32 num1, 2:i32 num2),
}
```
```cpp
// C++ server stub (generated)
#include "Calculator.h"
// ...existing code for server setup...
```

## Service Discovery (Concept)
- Use a registry (e.g., Zookeeper, Consul) for service endpoints.

## Performance Measurement
- Use timers in client code to measure latency and throughput.
