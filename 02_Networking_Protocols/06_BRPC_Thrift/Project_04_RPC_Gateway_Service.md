# Project: RPC Gateway Service

## Description
Develop a gateway service that routes requests to multiple backend services, implements protocol translation, and provides monitoring and tracing.

## C++ Example: Gateway Routing Logic
```cpp
// Pseudo-code for routing
if (request.type == "thrift") {
    // Forward to Thrift backend
} else if (request.type == "brpc") {
    // Forward to BRPC backend
}
```

## Monitoring and Tracing
- Integrate logging and distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTracing).
