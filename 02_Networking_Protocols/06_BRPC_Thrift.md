# BRPC and Thrift

## Overview
BRPC (Baidu RPC) and Apache Thrift are powerful RPC (Remote Procedure Call) frameworks designed for building high-performance, scalable distributed systems. These frameworks enable communication between services written in different programming languages, making them essential tools for developing microservices and distributed applications. This learning path covers the architecture, implementation patterns, and performance optimization techniques for both frameworks.
