# Project: RDMA-based Key-Value Store

## Description
Create a simple key-value store using RDMA. Implement both two-sided and one-sided operations and benchmark performance.

## Example Code
```c
// Pseudocode for RDMA-based key-value store
// 1. Register memory for key-value pairs
// 2. Use RDMA Write for put, RDMA Read for get
// 3. Benchmark latency and throughput
```
