## Description
Build a data processing pipeline with RDMA, implement zero-copy data flow, and measure throughput and latency.

## Example Code
```c
// Pseudocode for RDMA data pipeline
// 1. Register memory regions for pipeline stages
// 2. Use RDMA Write/Read for data transfer
// 3. Measure and report performance
