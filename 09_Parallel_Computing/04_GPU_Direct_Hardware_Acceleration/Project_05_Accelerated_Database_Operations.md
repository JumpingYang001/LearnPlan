# Project: Accelerated Database Operations

## Description
Build database operations accelerated by GPUs, implementing direct data transfer from storage to GPU and performance comparison.

## Example Code
```cpp
// Example: Pseudocode for GPU-accelerated database query
void gpu_accelerated_query() {
    // Load data from NVMe to GPU memory
    // Execute query on GPU
    // Compare with CPU-based query
}
```
