# OpenMP and Parallel Programming

## Overview
OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior. OpenMP provides a portable, scalable model for developers of shared memory parallel applications that gives programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications.
