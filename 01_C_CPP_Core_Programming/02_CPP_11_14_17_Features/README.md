## üîß Setup and Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compliant compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- Optional: Google Test for running unit tests

### Building Projects
Each project includes its own `CMakeLists.txt`. General build process:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd Projects/01_Move_Semantics_Implementation

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build
cmake --build .

# Run examples (if available)
./basic_usage
./performance_tests
```

### IDE Setup
- **Visual Studio Code**: Install C++ extensions and CMake tools
- **CLion**: Import CMake projects directly
- **Visual Studio**: Use "Open Folder" with CMake projects
- **Qt Creator**: Import CMakeLists.txt files

## üìù Learning Tips

### Study Techniques
1. **Read First, Code Second**: Understand concepts before implementation
2. **Incremental Learning**: Master one feature before moving to the next
3. **Practice Variations**: Modify examples to test understanding
4. **Performance Testing**: Use benchmarks to understand impact
5. **Code Review**: Compare your solutions with provided examples

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Move Semantics**: Don't assume moving is always faster
- **Smart Pointers**: Avoid circular references with shared_ptr
- **Templates**: Watch out for compilation time and error message clarity
- **Concurrency**: Always consider data races and deadlocks
- **Auto**: Be careful with proxy types and reference lifetimes

### Best Practices
- Use RAII consistently for resource management
- Prefer const correctness and immutability when possible
- Apply the Rule of Zero/Three/Five appropriately
- Choose the right smart pointer for the job
- Use structured bindings for cleaner code
- Leverage constexpr for compile-time optimization
