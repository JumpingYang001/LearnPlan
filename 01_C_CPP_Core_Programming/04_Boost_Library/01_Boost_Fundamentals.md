# Boost Fundamentals

*Duration: 1 week*

## Overview

This section covers the fundamental concepts of the Boost C++ Libraries, including organization, installation, and integration with build systems.

## Learning Topics

### Library Organization and Structure
- Understanding Boost library architecture
- Header-only vs compiled libraries
- Library dependencies and relationships
- Boost namespace organization

### Installation and Building
- Installing Boost from source
- Using package managers (vcpkg, Conan, apt, brew)
- Building specific libraries
- Cross-platform considerations

### Integration with CMake and Other Build Systems
- Finding Boost with FindBoost
- Using Boost::target_link_libraries
- CMake best practices for Boost
- Integration with other build systems (Bazel, Meson)

### Versioning and Compatibility
- Boost versioning scheme
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Migration between Boost versions
- Compiler compatibility matrix

### Documentation and Resources
- Navigating Boost documentation
- Understanding library reference formats
- Finding examples and tutorials
- Community resources and support

## Practical Exercises

1. **Setup Exercise**
   - Install Boost on your system
   - Create a simple CMake project that uses Boost
   - Verify installation with a simple program

2. **Library Survey**
   - Explore the Boost directory structure
   - Identify header-only vs compiled libraries
   - Create a dependency map for common libraries

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Configure custom Boost build options
   - Build only required libraries
   - Test cross-compilation setup

## Code Examples

### Basic CMake Integration
```cmake
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system filesystem thread)

target_link_libraries(my_target 
    Boost::system 
    Boost::filesystem 
    Boost::thread
)
```

### Simple Boost Program
```cpp
#include <boost/version.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Using Boost " 
              << BOOST_VERSION / 100000 << "."
              << BOOST_VERSION / 100 % 1000 << "."
              << BOOST_VERSION % 100 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Assessment

- Can install and configure Boost on multiple platforms
- Understands library organization and dependencies
- Can integrate Boost with modern build systems
- Knows how to find appropriate documentation and resources
