## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Boost Libraries**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   
   # macOS with Homebrew
   brew install boost
   
   # Windows with vcpkg
   vcpkg install boost
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**
   ```cpp
   #include <boost/version.hpp>
   #include <iostream>
   
   int main() {
       std::cout << "Boost version: " << BOOST_VERSION << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **CMake Configuration**
   ```cmake
   find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system filesystem thread)
   target_link_libraries(your_target ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
   ```

## Migration Notes

### To Modern C++ (C++11 and later)
Many Boost libraries have been adopted into the C++ standard library:
- `boost::shared_ptr` → `std::shared_ptr`
- `boost::function` → `std::function`
- `boost::regex` → `std::regex`
- `boost::thread` → `std::thread`
- `boost::optional` → `std::optional` (C++17)
- `boost::variant` → `std::variant` (C++17)
- `boost::filesystem` → `std::filesystem` (C++17)

Consider using standard library equivalents for new projects while maintaining Boost for compatibility or additional features.

## Contributing
