# Fundamentals of Threading Concepts

*Duration: 1 week*

## Concepts to Master

### Process vs Thread
- Understanding the difference between processes and threads
- Memory space sharing and isolation patterns
- Resource allocation differences
- Performance implications

### Thread Creation and Termination
- Basic thread lifecycle management
- Creating threads programmatically
- Proper thread termination techniques
- Resource cleanup considerations

### Thread States and Lifecycle
- **New**: Thread created but not yet started
- **Runnable**: Thread ready to execute
- **Running**: Thread currently executing
- **Blocked**: Thread waiting for resources
- **Terminated**: Thread finished execution

### Benefits and Challenges of Multi-threading

#### Benefits
- Improved performance on multi-core systems
- Better resource utilization
- Enhanced program responsiveness
- Concurrent task execution

#### Challenges
- Race conditions and data races
- Deadlocks and livelocks
- Synchronization complexity
- Debugging difficulties

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Explain the fundamental concepts of threading
- Identify when to use threading vs single-threaded approaches
- Understand the basic challenges in multi-threaded programming
- Recognize different thread states and transitions

## Study Materials

### Recommended Reading
- Chapter 1-2 of "Programming with POSIX Threads" by David R. Butenhof
- Linux Programming Interface - Thread concepts chapter

### Practice Questions
1. What are the main differences between a process and a thread?
2. When would you choose multi-threading over multi-processing?
3. What resources are shared between threads in the same process?
4. What are the potential risks of concurrent execution?
