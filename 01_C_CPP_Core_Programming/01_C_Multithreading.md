*Last Updated: May 25, 2025*

## Overview

Multi-threading in C allows for concurrent execution of code, enabling efficient use of modern multi-core processors and improved program responsiveness. This learning track focuses on understanding and implementing threading concepts in C.

## Learning Path

- Thread pools
  - Design and implementation
  - Work queue management
  - Dynamic sizing
- Thread cancellation and cleanup
- Implementing task-based parallelism
- Threadpool libraries

### 7. Performance Considerations (1 week)
[See details in 07_Performance_Considerations.md](01_C_Multithreading/07_Performance_Considerations.md)
- Thread overhead
- Context switching costs
- Cache coherency issues
- False sharing and padding techniques
- Scalability analysis

### 8. Debugging Threaded Applications (1 week)
[See details in 08_Debugging_Threaded_Applications.md](01_C_Multithreading/08_Debugging_Threaded_Applications.md)
