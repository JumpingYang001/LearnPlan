# BERT Architecture and Applications

## Topics
- BERT's bidirectional transformer approach
- Masked language modeling pre-training
- Fine-tuning for downstream tasks
- Applications using BERT models

### Example: Fine-tuning BERT (Python)
```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```
