# Project: MLOps Pipeline

## Objective
Develop an end-to-end pipeline from training to deployment, implementing automated testing and validation, and creating model registry and versioning system.

## Key Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline
- Automated testing and validation
- Model registry and versioning

### Example: Model Registry with MLflow
```python
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("param1", 5)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.9)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```
