# Project: Model Serving Platform

## Objective
Develop a scalable system for serving ML models, implementing batching and caching strategies, and creating monitoring and alerting components.

## Key Features
- Scalable model serving
- Batching and caching
- Monitoring and alerting

### Example: Caching with FastAPI and LRU
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from functools import lru_cache
app = FastAPI()

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def cached_predict(x):
    # Run inference
    return 0

@app.post('/predict')
def predict(x: int):
    return {"result": cached_predict(x)}
```
