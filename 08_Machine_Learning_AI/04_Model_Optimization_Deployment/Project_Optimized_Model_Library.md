# Project: Optimized Model Library

## Objective
Build a suite of optimized models for different constraints, implement various optimization techniques, and create benchmarking tools for comparison.

## Key Features
- Optimized models for different constraints
- Multiple optimization techniques
- Benchmarking tools

### Example: Benchmarking Optimized Models (Python)
```python
import time
def benchmark(model, input):
    start = time.time()
    _ = model(input)
    return time.time() - start
# Usage: benchmark(model, input)
```
