# Project: GPU-Accelerated Deep Learning Framework

## Objective
Build a lightweight neural network framework, implement CUDA kernels for core operations, and create benchmarking and profiling tools.

## Key Features
- Lightweight neural network framework
- CUDA kernels for core operations
- Benchmarking and profiling tools

### Example: Custom CUDA Kernel (Python)
```python
import cupy as cp
x = cp.arange(10)
y = x * 2
print(y)
```
