# Project: Optimized Inference Server

## Objective
Develop a high-performance model serving system, implement hardware-specific optimizations, and create load balancing and batching strategies.

## Key Features
- High-performance model serving
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Load balancing and batching

## Example: TensorRT Inference Server (Python)
```python
import tensorrt as trt
import numpy as np
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
engine_file = 'model.engine'
with open(engine_file, 'rb') as f, trt.Runtime(TRT_LOGGER) as runtime:
    engine = runtime.deserialize_cuda_engine(f.read())
    context = engine.create_execution_context()
    # Allocate buffers and run inference...
```

## Example: FastAPI Model Serving (Python)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.post('/predict')
def predict(data: dict):
    # Run inference using optimized backend
    return {"result": 0}
```

## Example: Load Balancing Command (Linux)
```sh
# Run multiple server instances and load balance with Nginx
nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
