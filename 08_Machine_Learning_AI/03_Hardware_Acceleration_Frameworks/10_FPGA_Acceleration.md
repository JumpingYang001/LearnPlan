# FPGA Acceleration

## Topics
- FPGA concepts for ML acceleration
- High-level synthesis (HLS)
- Dataflow architectures for ML
- FPGA accelerated functions

### Example: FPGA Acceleration with PYNQ (Python)
```python
from pynq import Overlay
ol = Overlay('design.bit')
# Interact with FPGA overlay
```
