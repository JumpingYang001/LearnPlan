# Project: Cross-Platform Acceleration Library

## Objective
Build a library supporting multiple hardware backends, implement a unified API for different accelerators, and create automatic kernel tuning capabilities.

## Key Features
- Multi-backend hardware support
- Unified API
- Automatic kernel tuning

### Example: Unified API Device Selection (Python)
```python
import torch
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = 'cuda'
else:
    device = 'cpu'
print('Using device:', device)
```
