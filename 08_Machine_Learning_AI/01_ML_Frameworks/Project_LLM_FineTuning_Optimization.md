# Project: LLM Fine-tuning and Optimization

## Objective
Fine-tune a LLM for a specific task, optimize for inference (quantization, pruning), and create a deployment pipeline.

## Key Features
- LLM fine-tuning
- Inference optimization (quantization, pruning)
- Deployment pipeline

### Example: LLM Fine-tuning (Python)
```python
# Use HuggingFace Transformers for fine-tuning
from transformers import Trainer
# trainer.train()
```
