# Project: Custom Model Training and Deployment

## Objective
Train a model with TensorFlow or PyTorch, convert to an optimized format (ONNX, TFLite), and deploy with a C++ inference engine.

## Key Features
- Model training (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Model conversion (ONNX/TFLite)
- C++ inference deployment

### Example: Model Conversion (Python)
```python
# Convert PyTorch model to ONNX
import torch
# torch.onnx.export(...)
```
