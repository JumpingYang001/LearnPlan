# Model Optimization and Deployment

## Overview
Model optimization and deployment are critical aspects of machine learning engineering that bridge the gap between research prototypes and production systems. This learning path covers techniques for optimizing ML models for efficiency, performance, and resource constraints, as well as strategies for deploying models in various environments, from cloud to edge. Understanding these topics is essential for building real-world ML applications that deliver value at scale.
