# Hardware Acceleration Frameworks

## Overview
Hardware acceleration frameworks enable machine learning models to run efficiently on specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and custom ASICs. These frameworks provide abstractions, optimizations, and tools that allow developers to leverage hardware capabilities without deep expertise in hardware architecture. Understanding these frameworks is essential for deploying high-performance machine learning systems in production, especially for computationally intensive tasks like deep learning inference and training.
