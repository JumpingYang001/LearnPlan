# Project: BDD-Driven Feature Development

## Description
Implement features using Behavior-Driven Development. Create Gherkin scenarios for requirements and build a testing framework that supports BDD.

## Example: Gherkin Scenario and Python Behave Step
```gherkin
# features/login.feature
Feature: User login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user is redirected to the dashboard
```
```python
# features/steps/login_steps.py
from behave import given, when, then
@given('the user is on the login page')
def step_impl(context):
    pass
@when('the user enters valid credentials')
def step_impl(context):
    pass
@then('the user is redirected to the dashboard')
def step_impl(context):
    pass
```
