# Mocking and Test Isolation

## Overview
Mocking and test isolation techniques are essential for effective unit testing by allowing components to be tested in isolation from their dependencies. These techniques enable developers to create focused, deterministic tests that verify specific behaviors without being affected by external systems, complex dependencies, or non-deterministic factors. Understanding mocking frameworks and isolation patterns is crucial for building maintainable test suites and practicing test-driven development effectively.
