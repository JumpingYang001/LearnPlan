# PyTest

## Overview
PyTest is a robust Python testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It is more powerful than the built-in unittest module and has become the de facto standard for testing in Python projects. PyTest offers features like fixtures, parameterization, and plugins that simplify test creation and execution.

## Learning Path

### 1. PyTest Basics (1 week)
[See details in 01_PyTest_Basics.md](02_PyTest/01_PyTest_Basics.md)
- Understand the PyTest philosophy and advantages
- Learn to write basic test functions
- Run tests with PyTest command-line interface
- Interpret test results and reports

### 2. Assertions and Test Organization (1 week)
[See details in 02_Assertions_Test_Organization.md](02_PyTest/02_Assertions_Test_Organization.md)
- Master PyTest's powerful assertion capabilities
- Use markers to categorize tests
- Organize tests in classes and modules
- Skip tests and mark tests as expected to fail

### 3. Fixtures (2 weeks)
[See details in 03_Fixtures.md](02_PyTest/03_Fixtures.md)
- Understand the fixture concept in PyTest
- Create and use function and module-level fixtures
- Implement fixture factories
- Use built-in fixtures like `capsys`, `monkeypatch`, and `tmpdir`

### 4. Parameterization (1 week)
[See details in 04_Parameterization.md](02_PyTest/04_Parameterization.md)
- Implement parameterized tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple test cases
- Create custom parameter generators
- Test with different combinations of parameters

### 5. Mocking and Patching (1 week)
[See details in 05_Mocking_Patching.md](02_PyTest/05_Mocking_Patching.md)
- Use `monkeypatch` for runtime modifications
- Integrate with the `unittest.mock` library
- Implement spy objects and verify call counts
- Mock complex objects and behaviors

### 6. Plugins and Extensions (1 week)
[See details in 06_Plugins_Extensions.md](02_PyTest/06_Plugins_Extensions.md)
- Discover and use community plugins
- Implement custom hooks and plugins
- Use coverage plugins to measure test coverage
- Integrate with CI/CD tools using PyTest plugins

### 7. Advanced PyTest Features (1 week)
[See details in 07_Advanced_Features.md](02_PyTest/07_Advanced_Features.md)
- Master fixture scopes and dependencies
- Use parallel test execution
- Implement custom test collection strategies
- Create custom test reporters
