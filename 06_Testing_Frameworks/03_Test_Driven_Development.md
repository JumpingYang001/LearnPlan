# Test-Driven Development

## Overview
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The process involves writing a failing test, implementing the minimal code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code while maintaining the test coverage. TDD promotes cleaner, more maintainable code, better test coverage, and improved design by forcing developers to think about requirements and interfaces before implementation.
