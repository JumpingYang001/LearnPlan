# GoogleTest (GTest)

## Overview
GoogleTest is a C++ testing framework developed by Google. It provides a rich set of assertions, test fixtures, and test runners that make it easy to write and run tests. GoogleTest helps in creating repeatable tests for C++ code that can be integrated into continuous integration systems.

## Learning Path

### 1. GoogleTest Basics (1 week)
- Understand the basic structure of GoogleTest
- Learn to write simple assertions (ASSERT_* and EXPECT_*)
- Understand the difference between fatal and non-fatal assertions
- Create and run basic test cases

### 2. Test Fixtures (1 week)
- Understand test fixtures and how they help in code reuse
- Learn to use SetUp() and TearDown() methods
- Create test suites with shared resources
- Implement parameterized test fixtures

### 3. Advanced Assertions and Matchers (1 week)
- Master advanced assertions
- Learn to use GoogleMock matchers with GoogleTest
- Create custom matchers for complex validations
- Use string and container-specific assertions

### 4. Parameterized Testing (1 week)
- Implement tests with different parameters
- Use value-parameterized tests
- Implement type-parameterized tests
- Create test generators for complex test cases

### 5. Death Tests and Exception Testing (1 week)
- Learn to test functions that are expected to crash
- Implement death tests with different styles
- Test for specific exception types
- Verify exception messages

### 6. Integration with Build Systems (1 week)
- Integrate GoogleTest with CMake
- Set up test discovery and execution
- Configure test output formats
- Implement test filtering and sharding

## Projects

1. **Unit Testing Library**
   - Create a small utility library with comprehensive GoogleTest coverage
   - Implement fixtures, parameterized tests, and custom matchers
   - Generate test reports and analyze coverage

2. **Legacy Code Testing**
   - Take an existing codebase with minimal testing
   - Implement a test suite with GoogleTest
   - Refactor as needed to improve testability

3. **Test-Driven Development Project**
   - Build a data structure or algorithm implementation using TDD
   - Write tests first, then implement the functionality
   - Achieve high test coverage and document the process

4. **Mocking Framework Integration**
   - Build a system with external dependencies
   - Use GoogleMock to isolate components for testing
   - Create a comprehensive test suite with mocks and stubs

5. **Continuous Integration Pipeline**
   - Set up a CI pipeline that runs GoogleTest tests
   - Configure test result visualization
   - Implement automatic test execution on code changes
