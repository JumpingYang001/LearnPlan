# Project: Industrial IoT Monitoring System

## Description
Develop a system for industrial equipment monitoring using MQTT and/or CoAP for data collection, with analytics and alerting features.

## Example Code (Python, MQTT)
```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f'Received: {msg.topic} {msg.payload}')
    # Add analytics/alerting logic here

client = mqtt.Client()
client.on_message = on_message
client.connect('localhost', 1883)
client.subscribe('factory/sensor')
client.loop_forever()
```
