# GEM300 Standard

## Overview
GEM300 (Generic Equipment Model for 300mm wafer fabrication facilities) is an extension of the GEM (Generic Equipment Model) standard specifically designed for 300mm semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It provides additional functionality for carrier management, material control, enhanced remote commands, and other features required for modern 300mm wafer processing. GEM300 is defined in the SEMI E148 standard.
