# Project: Fault Detection and Classification System

## Description
Build a system for detecting equipment faults, implement statistical process control, and create maintenance prediction algorithms.

## Example Code
```python
# Pseudo-code for fault detection and classification
import statistics

def detect_faults(data):
    mean = statistics.mean(data)
    stdev = statistics.stdev(data)
    faults = [x for x in data if abs(x - mean) > 2 * stdev]
    return faults

sensor_data = [70, 72, 69, 120, 71, 68, 130]
faults = detect_faults(sensor_data)
print(f"Detected faults: {faults}")
```
