# Industrial Automation Protocols

## Overview
Industrial automation protocols are communication standards used in industrial settings to enable data exchange between devices, controllers, and systems. These protocols are essential for industrial automation, process control, and manufacturing systems. Understanding these protocols is crucial for developing and maintaining modern industrial control systems and implementing Industry 4.0 initiatives.
