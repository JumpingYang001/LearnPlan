# DeviceNet and ControlNet

## Explanation
DeviceNet and ControlNet are industrial networks based on CIP. DeviceNet is optimized for device-level communication, while ControlNet is used for high-speed, deterministic control.

## Example
```c
// Example: DeviceNet Device Initialization (Pseudocode)
devicenet_device_init();
devicenet_set_address(0x10);
devicenet_start_communication();
```
