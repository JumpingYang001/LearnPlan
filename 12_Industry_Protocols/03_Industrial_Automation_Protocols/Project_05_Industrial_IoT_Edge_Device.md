# Project: Industrial IoT Edge Device

## Description
Build an edge device that connects industrial equipment to the cloud, supports multiple industrial protocols, and provides data preprocessing and analytics.

## Example Code
```python
# Example: Edge Device Data Preprocessing (Python)
def preprocess_data(raw_data):
    # Filter, normalize, and aggregate data
    processed = [x/100.0 for x in raw_data]
    return processed

raw_data = [100, 200, 300]
print("Processed Data:", preprocess_data(raw_data))
# Add protocol support and cloud integration
```
