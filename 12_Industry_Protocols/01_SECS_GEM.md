# Semiconductor Equipment Communications Standard (SECS/GEM)

## Overview
The Semiconductor Equipment Communications Standard (SECS) and Generic Equipment Model (GEM) are industry standards that define communication protocols for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. SECS/GEM enables automated equipment control, data collection, and equipment status monitoring in semiconductor fabrication facilities. These standards are essential for Industry 4.0 implementation in semiconductor manufacturing.
