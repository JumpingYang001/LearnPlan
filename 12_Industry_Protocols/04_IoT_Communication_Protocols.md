# IoT Communication Protocols

## Overview
Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols are standards that enable communication between IoT devices, gateways, and cloud platforms. These protocols are designed to address the unique challenges of IoT communications, such as limited bandwidth, power constraints, security concerns, and scalability requirements. Understanding these protocols is essential for developing effective IoT solutions across various domains.
