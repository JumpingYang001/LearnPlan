# GIO and Asynchronous Programming

## GIO Basics
- File operations
- Input/output streams
- Volume monitoring
- Application resources

## Asynchronous Operations
- GTask
- Cancellable operations
- Progress reporting
- Error handling

## Threads in GTK+
- Thread safety considerations
- g_idle_add and g_timeout_add
- Worker threads
- Thread synchronization

### Example: Asynchronous File Read
```c
GFile *file = g_file_new_for_path("data.txt");
g_file_load_contents_async(file, NULL, on_file_loaded, NULL);
```
