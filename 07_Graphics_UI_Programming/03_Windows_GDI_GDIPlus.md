# Windows GDI/GDI+

## Overview
The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) and its enhanced version GDI+ are Windows graphics APIs that enable applications to display information on screens and printers. GDI provides fundamental graphics capabilities, while GDI+ offers an object-oriented interface with advanced features like alpha blending, gradient fills, and more sophisticated font handling. Despite newer alternatives, GDI/GDI+ remains important for Windows desktop application development, especially for applications requiring compatibility with older Windows versions.
