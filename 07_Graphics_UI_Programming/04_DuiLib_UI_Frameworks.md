# DuiLib and UI Frameworks

## Overview
DuiLib (also known as DirectUI Library) is a lightweight, high-performance UI framework for Windows applications. It provides an XML-based approach to UI design that separates presentation from logic. This learning path covers DuiLib and other important UI frameworks, offering a comprehensive understanding of modern UI development approaches for desktop applications. These frameworks enable developers to create rich, responsive user interfaces with less code and greater maintainability.
