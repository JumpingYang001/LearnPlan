# V8 JavaScript Engine

## Overview
V8 is Chrome's high-performance JavaScript engine. It uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation and advanced garbage collection to execute JavaScript efficiently.

## Key Concepts
- JIT compilation
- Garbage collection
- Performance profiling

## Example: Embedding V8-like Scripting in C++ (Pseudo)
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Pseudo-code for embedding a scripting engine
void executeScript(const std::string& code) {
    std::cout << "Executing: " << code << std::endl;
    // In real V8, this would parse and execute JS code
}

int main() {
    executeScript("console.log('Hello from V8!')");
    return 0;
}
```

This example shows the concept of executing scripts, as V8 does internally.
