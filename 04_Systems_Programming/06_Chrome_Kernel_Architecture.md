# Chrome Kernel Architecture

## Overview
Chrome's architecture is built around a multi-process model with a sophisticated internal structure often referred to as the "Chrome Kernel." This architecture separates browser functionality into different processes for improved security, stability, and performance. Understanding Chrome's internal architecture is valuable for browser extension developers, web developers concerned with performance, and engineers building browser-based applications. This learning path explores Chrome's process model, rendering pipeline, JavaScript engine, security model, and extension system.
