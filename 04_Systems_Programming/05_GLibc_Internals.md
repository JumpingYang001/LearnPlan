# GLibc Internals

## Overview
The GNU C Library (glibc) is the GNU Project's implementation of the C standard library. It's a crucial component of most Linux systems, providing essential functionality for C programs, including system calls, string manipulation, memory management, I/O operations, and much more. Understanding glibc internals is valuable for systems programmers, performance engineers, and anyone debugging complex Linux applications. This learning path explores the architecture, implementation details, and optimization techniques of glibc.
