# Windows System Programming

## Overview
Windows system programming involves developing software that interacts directly with the Windows operating system through its various APIs. This includes managing processes, threads, memory, file systems, and other system resources. Understanding Windows system programming is essential for developing high-performance applications, system utilities, and software that requires deep integration with the Windows operating system.
