# Project: Event-Sourced Microservices Platform

## Description
Develop a system using Kafka as an event store, implement event sourcing and CQRS patterns, and create event-driven workflows between services.

## Example Code
```java
// Event sourcing with Kafka (pseudo-code)
class OrderService {
  void handleCommand(Command cmd) {
    Event event = process(cmd);
    kafkaProducer.send("order-events", event);
  }
}

// CQRS: Separate read/write models
```
