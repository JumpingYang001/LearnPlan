# Argo Workflow

## Overview
Argo Workflow is a container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. It's implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition) and allows you to describe multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks where each step is run in a container. Argo Workflow is designed for complex computational workflows like machine learning, data processing, and CI/CD pipelines.
