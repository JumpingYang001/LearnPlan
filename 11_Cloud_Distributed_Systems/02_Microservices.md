# Microservices Architecture

## Overview
Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where a large application is built as a suite of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is focused on a specific business capability, can be developed independently, and is deployable on its own. This architectural style enables organizations to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, reliably, and scalably.
