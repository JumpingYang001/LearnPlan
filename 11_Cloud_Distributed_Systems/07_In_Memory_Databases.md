# In-Memory Databases

## Overview
In-memory databases (IMDBs) store data primarily in system memory (RAM) rather than on disk, enabling significantly faster data access. They are designed for applications requiring high-throughput, low-latency data access and are especially valuable in real-time analytics, caching, session management, and as accelerators for traditional databases. This learning path covers various in-memory database technologies, implementation patterns, and integration strategies for modern distributed systems.
