# Authentication and Authorization

## Overview
Authentication and authorization are fundamental security concepts in modern distributed systems. Authentication verifies the identity of users or systems, while authorization determines what authenticated entities are allowed to do. Understanding these concepts, along with related technologies like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), is essential for building secure applications and services.
