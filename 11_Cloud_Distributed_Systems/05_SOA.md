# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

## Overview
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design where application components provide services to other components through a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. SOA represents an important stage in the evolution of application development and integration that preceded and laid foundations for microservices architecture.

## Relationship to Microservices

SOA laid the groundwork for microservices architecture, but there are key differences:
- SOA typically uses heavyweight protocols like SOAP, while microservices prefer lightweight protocols like REST
- SOA often centers around an Enterprise Service Bus, while microservices use simpler messaging mechanisms
- SOA services are usually larger and more monolithic than microservices
- SOA focuses on reuse across the enterprise, while microservices focus on independence and deployability
