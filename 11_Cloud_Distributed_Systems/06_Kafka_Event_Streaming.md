# Kafka for Event Streaming

## Overview
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log. It's designed for high-throughput, low-latency handling of real-time data feeds and has become the foundation for event-driven architectures in many enterprises. This learning path covers Kafka architecture, implementation, and integration patterns for building robust event streaming solutions.
